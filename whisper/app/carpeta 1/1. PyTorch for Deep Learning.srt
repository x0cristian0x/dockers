1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Machine learning and data science are already the hottest fields in the world,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and it's time to turn it up a notch.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Welcome to the hottest place to learn PyTorch and become a master of deep learning.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
If you don't already know what PyTorch is, here's the deal.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
PyTorch is a machine learning framework written in Python code.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It enables you to craft state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms like neural networks

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
powering much of today's artificial intelligence applications.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Sounds hot, right?

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
That's because PyTorch is on fire right now.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And I don't just mean the name or the logo.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's used by leading tech companies like Tesla to build the computer vision systems for their self-driving cars,

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Meta to power the curation and understanding systems for their content timelines,

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Apple to create computationally enhanced photography,

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
and even automated weed-killing tractors.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Plus, much of the latest machine learning research is done and published using PyTorch code.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So knowing how to write and read PyTorch code means you'll be at the cutting edge of the field.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
You know the best way to learn is by doing right?

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Well, consider this course a PyTorch momentum builder.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Side by side, line by line, we'll be writing PyTorch code together apprenticeship style,

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
helping you learn the PyTorch skills you'll use every day as a data scientist or a machine learning engineer.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
We'll start with the bare-bone fundamentals.

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So even if you're new to machine learning, you'll be caught up to speed.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Then we'll explore more advanced areas including PyTorch workflows,

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
PyTorch neural network classification, computer vision, custom data sets, experiment tracking, model deployment,

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
and my personal favorite, transfer learning.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:58,000
A powerful technique for taking what one machine learning model has learned on another problem and applying it to your own.

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Along the way, you'll build three milestone projects surrounding an overarching project called Food Vision,

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
a neural network computer vision model to classify images of food.

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
These milestone projects will help you practice using PyTorch

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
whilst covering important machine learning concepts

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
and create a portfolio you can show to employers and say,

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
here's what I've done.

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
By the end of this course, you'll have a vast amount of hands-on experience with PyTorch

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
and will be comfortable interacting with public PyTorch projects,

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
building your own PyTorch projects and accelerating your career in the wonderful world of machine learning.

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And silly me, I almost forgot to introduce myself.

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm Daniel Burke, your PyTorch instructor.

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm a self-taught machine learning engineer with experience at one of Australia's fastest growing artificial intelligence companies.

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And now I teach the latest in-demand machine learning skills to thousands of students across the globe.

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
In this course, we're going to learn to master PyTorch together.

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I want you to be able to think and work through machine learning problems like a machine learning engineer does.

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So when it comes time to apply your new skills as a machine learning engineer,

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
you've already had plenty of practice because that's the goal, right?

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
If you want to learn the skills required for a career in machine learning,

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
if you want to learn the most popular machine learning framework used by companies like Tesla and Apple,

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
if you like to learn by doing, if you'd like to master PyTorch,

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
you've come to the right place.

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'll see you inside.

49
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Let's code.

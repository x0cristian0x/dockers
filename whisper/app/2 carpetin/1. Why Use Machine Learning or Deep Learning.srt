00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome back. So in the last video we covered briefly the difference between

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
traditional programming and machine learning and again I don't want to spend

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
too much time on definitions. I'd rather you see this in practice. And I left you

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
with the question, why would you want to use machine learning or deep learning?

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Well let's think of a good reason. Why not? I mean if we had to write all those

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
handwritten rules to reproduce Alcison and Grandmother's roast chicken dish all

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
the time that would be quite cumbersome right? Well let's draw a line on that. Why

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
not? What's a better reason? Kind of what we just said right? For a complex problem

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
can you think of all the rules? So let's imagine we're trying to build a self

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
driving car. Now if you've learned to drive you've probably done so in maybe

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
20 hours, 100 hours, but now I'll give you a task of writing down every single

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
rule about driving. How do you back out of your driveway? How do you turn left

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and go down the street? How do you park a reverse park? How do you stop at an

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
intersection? How do you know how fast to go somewhere? So we just listed half a

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
dozen rules but you could probably go a fair few more. You might get into the

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
thousands. And so for a complex problem such as driving can you think of all the

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
rules? Well probably not. So that's where machine learning and deep learning come

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
into help. And so this is a beautiful comment I like to share with you on one

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
of my YouTube videos is my 2020 machine learning roadmap and this is from

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Yashui. I'm probably going to mispronounce this if I even try to. But

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Yashui says I think you can use ML. So ML is machine learning. I'm going to use

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
that a lot throughout the course by the way. ML is machine learning just so you

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
know. For literally anything as long as you can convert it into numbers. Ah

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
that's what we said before machine learning is turning something into

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
computer readable numbers and then programming it to find patterns except

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
with a machine learning algorithm typically we write the algorithm and it

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
finds the patterns not us. And so literally it could be anything any input

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
or output from the universe. That's pretty darn cool about machine learning

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,000
right? But should you always use it just because it could be used for anything?

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Well I'd like to also introduce you to Google's number one rule of machine

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
learning. Now if you can build a simple rule

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
based system such as the step of five rules that we had to map the ingredients

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
to our Sicilian grandmother's roast chicken dish. If you can write just five

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
steps to do that that's going to work every time. Well you should probably do

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
that. So if you can build a simple rule based system that doesn't require machine

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
learning do that. And of course maybe it's not so very simple but maybe you

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
can just write some rules to solve the problem that you're working on. Now this

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
is from a wise software engineer which is I kind of hinted at it before. Rule one

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
of Google's machine learning handbook. Now I'm going to highly recommend you

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
read through that but we're not going to go through that in this video so check

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
that out you can Google that otherwise the links will be where you get links. So

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
just keep that in mind although machine learning is very powerful and very fun

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
and very excited it doesn't mean that you should always use it. I know this is

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
quite the thing to be saying at the start of a deep learning and machine

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
learning course but I just want you to keep in mind simple rule based systems

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
are still good. Machine learning isn't a solve-all for everything. Now let's have

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
a look at what deep learning is good for but I'm going to leave you on a

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
cliffhanger because we're going to check this out in the next video. See you soon.

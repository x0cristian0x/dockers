Hey there, I wanted to take a second at the end of it all, at the end of your learning journey

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:15,000
to just say this one thing and that is thank you. I know your time is valuable. We have limited time

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
on this earth and you decided to spend your time and your money frankly with us doing something

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
that takes a long time to learn. So truly from the bottom of our hearts I know it sounds cheesy

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
but thank you for dedicating your time and effort to this course. I hope you got what you wanted out

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
of it and congratulate yourself for getting this far because a lot of people start, a lot of people

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
have hopes of learning but they give up along the way. But you didn't do that. You worked through

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
the challenges, the problems and you got here. Now your learning journey doesn't end here. It keeps

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,000
going but I hope this created a foundation for you to go off and learn things on your own. Get

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
a promotion, get hired, start a new business. Whatever it may be, again thank you and best of

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
luck with your learning journey. This is just the beginning of whatever you decide to do in the future.

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So thank you and good luck.
